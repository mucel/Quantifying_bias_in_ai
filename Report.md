# Report 

A 4-page, double-column PDF report (4 pages excluding references), following a standard structure (where applicable): abstract, introduction, related work, (brief) data collection, dataset description with summary statistics, methods with math and description of main algorithms, results and findings, conclusions. This report will be evaluated according to how clearly and succinctly it is written, if the style is appropriate (e.g., figures with captions), if it contains all relevant contents, and how solid the results are.


### Report: 
- Author contributions: Did you indicate who contributed what, and was this an effective division of tasks?

- Background: Does the problem and goal of the project become clear? Is the background information correct and would your classmates understand it?

- Quality of the specific research question: Is the question or topic addressed in the project related to text mining and can it be addressed by methods we learned about in the course?

- Method and data: Does the described approach/approaches effectively address (part of) the research question or problem? Are concrete enough details provided about the dataset(s) and methods(s) (algorithms, libraries) that you used? Are the essential properties of your dataset and how you collected it clearly described? Is there enough information that someone could reproduce the results of your project independently? Do you describe an effective validation/evaluation of your method?

- Results: Are the results well analysed, evaluated and presented?

- Conclusions: Are the results accurately summarized? Did you critically reflect upon your results? Are open issues and future work well covered?

- Original contribution: Did you find the academic literature that is the most similar to what you are doing? What is the novelty of your proposal compared to what is described in the literature (gap in the literature), and does the report make this clear without overselling your idea?

- Clarity of expression: Is the language in the report precise and accurate? Are you writing in an academic style/register while still remaining clear and not overusing jargon or uncommon/specific words?

- Figures/graphs/tables: If relevant, are they properly used?

- Supplementary materials: Does your report reference elements from your repository when appropriate?

- Structure: Are all the aspects of the standard structure (if applicable) correctly included and is the report well-structured?
